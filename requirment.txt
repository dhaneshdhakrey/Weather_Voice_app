Assignment Overview
Duration: 1-2 days
Submission: GitHub repository link
Focus: Voice agent integration with custom API function
This is a quick assessment to evaluate your:
● Ability to work with voice agent frameworks
● API integration skills
● Code quality and problem-solving
● Learning ability with new technologies

Use Case: Simple Weather Voice Assistant
Build a voice assistant that can tell users the weather for any city they ask about.
Example Interaction:
User: "What's the weather in Mumbai?"
Agent: "Let me check that for you... The weather in Mumbai is currently
28°C and sunny. It's a beautiful day!"
User: "How about Bangalore?"
Agent: "In Bangalore, it's 22°C with partly cloudy skies. Perfect weather!"
User: "Will it rain in Pune tomorrow?"
Agent: "Tomorrow in Pune, there's a 60% chance of rain with temperatures
around 24°C. You might want to carry an umbrella!"

Technical Requirements

Option 1: Use LiveKit
LiveKit Agents Framework - Perfect for voice agents!
Resources:
● GitHub: https://github.com/livekit-examples
● Docs: https://docs.livekit.io/agents/
● Quick Start: https://docs.livekit.io/agents/quickstart/
Option 2: Alternative Frameworks (If you prefer)
● Vocode: https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-python
● Pipecat: https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat
● Web Speech API: Browser-based (simpler but less powerful)

What You Need to Build
Core Requirements (Must Have):
1. Voice Input/Output
○ User speaks their query
○ Agent responds with voice
○ Use any framework from above (LiveKit recommended)
2. Custom Weather Function (Most Important)
○ Integrate Weather API (OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI.com, etc.)
○ Extract city name from user's speech
○ Fetch real-time weather data
○ Agent speaks the weather information naturally
3. Error Handling
○ Handle city not found
○ Handle API failures gracefully
○ Handle unclear speech input

Deliverables:
1. Working voice agent (can run locally)
2. Weather API integration function

3. Clean code with comments
4. README with setup instructions
5. Screen recording (2-3 min) showing it working

Sample Resources
Weather APIs (Choose One - All have free tiers):
1. OpenWeatherMap (Recommended)
○ https://openweathermap.org/api
○ Free: 1000 calls/day
○ Easy to use
2. WeatherAPI.com
○ https://www.weatherapi.com/
○ Free: 1M calls/month
○ Good documentation
3. Tomorrow.io
○ https://www.tomorrow.io/weather-api/
○ Free tier available
Deliverables Checklist
Before submitting, ensure you have:
● GitHub Repository (public)
○ Clean code structure
○ Comments explaining key functions
○ Include a README that clearly explains your approach.
